## Linear Regression in Python

- what is regression?

Regression analysis is one of the most important fields in statistics and machine learning.
Regression searches for relationships among variables. For example, you can observe several employees of some company and try to understand how their salaries depend on their features, such as experience, education level, role, city of employment, and so on.

There are many regression methods available. Linear regression is one of them.

- When Do we Need Regression?

We need need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related. For example, you can use it to determine if and to what extent experience or gender impacts salaries.

## Linear Regression
Linear regression is probably one of the most important and widely used regression techniques, and one of the fundamental statistical and machine learning techniques. It’s among the simplest regression methods. One of its main advantages is the ease of interpreting results.

When implementing linear regression of some dependent variable 𝑦 on the set of independent variables 𝐱 = (𝑥₁, …, 𝑥ᵣ), where 𝑟 is the number of predictors, you assume a linear relationship between 𝑦 and 𝐱: 𝑦 = 𝛽₀ + 𝛽₁𝑥₁ + ⋯ + 𝛽ᵣ𝑥ᵣ + 𝜀. This equation is the regression equation. 𝛽₀, 𝛽₁, …, 𝛽ᵣ are the regression coefficients, and 𝜀 is the random error.
