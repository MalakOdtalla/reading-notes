## Linux Command line

From [ Bash Command Line Tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/),I covered the basics of working with the Linux command line, to get the computer to do useful work, without using the graphical user interface; windows and buttons, and I will summraize some of these powerful commands:</br>

- In the first, I learned the **basic Navigation commands**, that helps in navigating around the Linux file system, So we can use the **pwd** (Print Working Directory) command to see where we are. and from our current location, we can move anywhere else with the **cd** (Change Directory) command, also there is **ls** (List Files) command to perform a listing of the given path or our current directory.
- Also I learnead how create a directory structure, and Actualy its the first step we need to do, because it will help us organise the data in a manageable way, and we can create it by typing  **mkdir 'directory-name'** command which is short for Make Directory.
In Addition to that there is a alot of commands to manipulation files, ex:<br>
**rmdir 'directory name'**, to remove a directory (only if empty).<br>
**touch 'file name'**, to create a blank file.
**rm 'path'**, remove a file or directory.<br>
- The manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on our system including what they do, By typing **man 'command'** we will get access to a description of what the command does, as well as a list of all possible options and what they do.
-  And we can managing all the processes that running on our machine with the following command: **ps aux**
