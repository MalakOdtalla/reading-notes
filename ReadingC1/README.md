## Big – O asymptotic notation

It used for the analysis of the algorithm, it a mathematical tools to represent the time complexity of algorithms for asymptotic analysis.
Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used.
and we can express algorithmic complexity using the big-O notation. For a problem of size N:

<li> A constant-time function/method is “order 1” : O(1)</li>
<li>A linear-time function/method is “order N” : O(N)</li>
<li>A quadratic-time function/method is “order N squared” : O(N 2 )</li>
