## Pandas for Data Science

Pandas is a game-changer for data science and analytics, it more powerful than Excel and VBA. Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets, for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

Pandas uses fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with relational or labeled data both easy and intuitive.



This library can gives answers about the data. Like:

- Is there a correlation between two or more columns?
- What is average value?
- Max value?
- Min value?
