## Serverless 

Serverless is a cloud computing application development and execution model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure. 

It lets developers put all their focus into writing the best front-end application code and business logic they can.

Serverless does not mean 'no servers'

The name notwithstanding, there are most definitely servers in serverless computing. 'Serverless' describes the developer’s experience with those servers—they are invisible to the developer, who doesn't see them, manage them, or interact with them in any way.

## Pros and cons of serverless

## Pros
- Improved developer productivity
- Pay for execution only
- Develop in any language: Serverless is a polyglot environment, enabling developers to code in any language or framework.

## Cons
- Unacceptable latency for certain applications: Because serverless architectures forgo ongoing processes in favor of scaling up and down to zero, they also sometimes need to start up from zero to serve a new request
- Monitoring and debugging issues:  teams may find it difficult or impossible to monitor or debug serverless functions using existing tools or processes.
- Higher costs for stable or predictable workloads.
