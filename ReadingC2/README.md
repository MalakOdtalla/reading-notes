## Reading Class 02

•	Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Its most basic terms, is the process of implementing code by writing tests first, seeing them fail, then writing the code to make the tests pass.
The process can be defined as such:

1- Write a failing unit test

 2- Make the unit test pass 

 3- Refactor Repeat this process for every feature, as is necessary.

•	( name == “main”)


When the interpreter runs a module, the name variable will be set as main if the module that is being run is the main program.
But if the code is importing the module from another module, then the name variable will be set to that module’s name.

•	Recursion


Recursion is the process of defining a problem (or the solution to a problem) in terms of (a simpler version of) itself. It helps in reduce the length of our code and make it easier to read and write.
