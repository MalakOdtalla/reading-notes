## Django Forms

 The Django framework is easy, fast, and secure. Due to its inbuilt libraries, many functions can be created with only a few lines of code rather than creating them from scratch.

One of these inbuilt packages is Django forms.

We use Django forms when collecting user data to save in a database. There are various model field forms available in Django for different purposes, and these fields have various patterns. The most important part of Django forms is that the form handles the basic aspects of form creation in only a few code lines.

However, the developer can choose to create a form from scratch, but it is a lot easier to use the Django model form, which handles a user formâ€™s basic aspect. These basic aspects include: creating the form, styling the form, receiving user data, validating the form (checking for errors), and saving the data in a database.
