## Whiteboard Interview

Whiteboard interviewing is the practice of asking candidates to solve technical questions on a whiteboard, piece of paper, or computer during the interview.

Best advice for going through a whiteboard interview:

### Communicate

### First, Restate the Question

Understand what theyâ€™re asking you to do? Prove it. Restate the question for them and seek affirmation.

### Ask About Edge Cases

Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem.

### Ask About Test Cases

Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass.

### Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense

start by writing pseudocode and fill in the actual code later. 

### Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good

You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code.
