## Next.js: The React Framework


There are many important details and problems the developer faces when building web applications with react:

Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.

You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.

You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.

You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.


Next.js provides a solution to all react problems, aims to have best-in-class developer experience and many built-in features, such as:
An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes), Automatic code splitting for faster page loads, API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions,Development environment with Fast Refresh support, and more..
